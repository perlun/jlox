# jlox

This is my version of jlox, following the guide given at http://craftinginterpreters.com

After a while, I started converting the code to C# and eventually, I stopped adding the new code as I was reading through book; I only did it in the C#-converted repo. You may find the code for it here: https://github.com/perlun/cslox/
